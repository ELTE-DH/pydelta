Pydelta v 0.1

pydelta is a commandline tool which implements 3 algorithms in the form 
described by Argamon in a paper on John Burrows Delta.
(S. Argamon, "Interpreting Burrowsâ€™s Delta: Geometric and Probabilistic 
Foundations," Literary and linguistic computing, vol. 23, iss. 2, pp. 131-147, 2008.)

Delta is a measure to describe the stylistic difference between texts. It is used
in computational stylistics, especially in author attribution. 
This is implementation is for research purposes only, If you want to use 
a reliable implementation with a nice Gui and much more features you should 
have a closer look at the great R tool 'stylo':

Usage of pydelta:
put your files into a subdirectory called 'corpus' under the directory
this script is living in. After the first run, you can use the file
delta.ini to set most of the important variables. 
The filenames should have the format authorname_title.txt (the first part of the 
authorname is used to color the labels)
